# Chance Result Filtering Fix

## Issue Description
Chance results were being included in the "last 3 spin results" calculation for betting recommendations, which was incorrect according to the specification.

### Problem Examples
- `[1, chance, 2, 3]` - Should analyze `[1, 2, 3]` but was analyzing all 4 results
- `[chance, chance, chance, 1, 2, 3]` - Should analyze `[1, 2, 3]` and status should be "Bet"

## Solution
Added filtering logic to exclude "chance" results from all pattern analysis functions, ensuring betting recommendations only consider actual number outcomes (1, 2, 5, 10, 2 rolls, 4 rolls).

## Changes Made

### 1. New Filter Function
**File:** `src/components/MonopolyTracker/utils/patterns.js`

```javascript
/**
 * Filter out chance results to get only actual number outcomes
 * Chance results should NOT count towards betting pattern analysis
 * @param {Array} results - Array of all game results
 * @returns {Array} Filtered results containing only number outcomes (1, 2, 5, 10, 2 rolls, 4 rolls)
 */
export const filterOutChanceResults = (results) => {
  return results.filter(result => result !== 'chance');
};
```

### 2. Updated Pattern Analysis Functions
All pattern analysis functions now use filtered results:

- ✅ `analyzeOnesPattern()` - Filters out chance results before analyzing frequency
- ✅ `analyzeLastThreeRolls()` - Only considers last 3 non-chance results
- ✅ `analyzeLastTwoRolls()` - Only considers last 2 non-chance results  
- ✅ `isGoodPattern()` - Core betting logic now ignores chance results

### 3. Updated Documentation
All function comments now specify that chance results are excluded from analysis.

## Test Results

All test scenarios pass correctly:

### ✅ Test 1: `[1, chance, 2, 3]`
- **Expected:** Last 3 = `[1, 2, 3]`
- **Result:** ✅ CORRECT - Filters to `[1, 2, 3]`

### ✅ Test 2: `[chance, chance, chance, 1, 2, 3]`
- **Expected:** Last 3 = `[1, 2, 3]`, Status = Bet
- **Result:** ✅ CORRECT - Filters to `[1, 2, 3]`, recommends BET

### ✅ Test 3: Mixed Scenario `[2, 5, chance, 1, chance, 2]`
- **Expected:** Should bet (contains "1" in last 3 non-chance)
- **Result:** ✅ CORRECT - Analyzes `[5, 1, 2]`, recommends BET

### ✅ Test 4: Bad Pattern `[chance, 2, chance, 5, chance, 10]`
- **Expected:** Should skip (no "1" in last 3 non-chance)
- **Result:** ✅ CORRECT - Analyzes `[2, 5, 10]`, recommends SKIP

### ✅ Test 5: Recent Chance `[5, 1, 2, chance]`
- **Expected:** Should bet (recent chance doesn't affect good pattern)
- **Result:** ✅ CORRECT - Analyzes `[5, 1, 2]`, recommends BET

## Impact

### ✅ Correct Behavior
- Betting recommendations now properly ignore chance results
- "Last 3 rolls" refers only to actual number outcomes
- Betting status correctly maintained even with chance events mixed in

### ✅ Backward Compatibility
- Existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to API
- All other pattern analysis features still work

### ✅ Specification Compliance
- Follows the user's requirement exactly
- Chance events don't interfere with betting logic
- Pattern analysis focuses on actual game outcomes

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/MonopolyTracker/utils/patterns.js` - Added filtering and updated all analysis functions

## Conclusion
The chance result filtering fix ensures that betting recommendations are based solely on actual number outcomes, properly implementing the requirement that chance results should not count towards the "last 3 spin results" for betting decisions.
