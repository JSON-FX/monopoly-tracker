- ✅ Resets consecutive losses to 0
- ✅ Resets current bet amount to base bet
- ✅ Accumulates pending cash in chanceState
- ✅ Adds "chance" to results array
- ✅ Adds a bet record with chanceType: "cash" and cashAmount

### What handleChanceCash DOES NOT do:

## Example State Change
Given:
- Current Capital: 970 (after 2 losses)
- Consecutive Losses: 2
- Current Bet Amount: 40 (martingale progression)
- Base Bet: 10

When `handleChanceCash(960)` is called:
- New Capital: 970 + 960 = 1930
- Consecutive Losses: 0
- Current Bet Amount: 10 (reset to base)
- New bet record added with `chanceType: "cash"` and `cashAmount: 960`
